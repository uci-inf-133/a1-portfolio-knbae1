        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 4th year majoring in Computer Science and Engineering under the Samueli School of Engineering.
            I came to UCI in 2022 from the San Francisco Bay Area intending to major in Biomedical Engineering. In my first quarter, I took ICS 32A as a filler class to continue what I learned in AP Computer Science, and the rest is history.
            <br>
            <br>As a Computer Science and Engineering student, I have had the opportunity to take classes under both the school of ICS and the school of engineering. 
            Some of my favorite classes have been COMPSCI 122B: Project in Data Management, COMPSCI 171: Intro to AI, COMPSCI 145: Project in Embedded Systems, and EECS 112L: Organization of Digital Computers Lab.
            <br><br>
            Beyond the required curriculum of the CSE degree, I have also been able to broaden my knowledge by taking classes for the minor in Bioinformatics,
            as well as the Data Management and Artifical Intelligence series.
            One of the main reasons why I chose to switch is because the CSE program is designed to allow students to explore both the software and hardware aspects of engineering, which matches my passion for programming, and background in robotics.
            <br><br>
            If you navigate to the <a href="project.html" class="section-link">Projects</a> page, you'll find a list of what I've worked on during my time at UCI, both extracurricularly and in the classroom. 
            For many of those projects, I couldn't have done it without the excellent teamwork from my peers. <br><br>Thanks for reading! <br><br>
