--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

I included multiple images, appropriate headers and paragraph text.
I also included links to external pages, like my Github and Linkedin profiles, as well as my resume.
I also made multiple pages, with a corresponding navigation bar in the header.
I used the footer HTML tag to link my Github, Linkedin, and email accounts.

(b) CSS features

I modified the link, text color, header color, basically every element with custom colors for cohesiveness.
I used the custom font "Inter" from Google Fonts as my primary font.
I modified padding and margins to enhance readability.


(c) Advanced features

I created a more complex page layout by including a navigation bar.
Added links to send me an email and schedule an appointmenet via Google Calendar.
Added embedded Youtube video of my class project.


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

No.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

7 hours

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I primarily consulted HTML Standard documentation, Stack Exchange, and W3 Schools.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

N/A

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No.
